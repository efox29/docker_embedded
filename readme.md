# Embedded Systems Docker Container

## Build docker image

Please follow the instructions for your own platform and update these instructions if things change.


To build image run the command
`./build_me.sh`

## Running docker image
Copy the `start_docker.sh` to your project folder and run from there. I have a folder called scripts, which I place this, and I modify the paths in the script to be the root of the project. The path needs to be the root of your project.
